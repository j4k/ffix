# ffix

Ever wanted to run code style across your entire codebase, but didn't want to mess up everyone's branches?

NOW **YOU** CAN

This is a quick little bash script that will scrape files that people are currently working on in their PRs
and then runs code style across your repo, excluding those files of course.

You should then be able to instantly merge neatly styled code back into the main branch without pissing people off.
